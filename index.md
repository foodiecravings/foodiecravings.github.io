Do you ever have a craving for a certain food while on campus? By using foodie cravings, you will know where
to get it, if you can get it now, what it looks likes, how much it will cost, and what your fellow students think
of the food. 

# Our Goals
We hope to create a website that can help everyone feed their cravings. Our website will be able to collect
information from campus restaurants. Some information that we plan to share with our users is the location, the 
hours of operation, some visual aids, the price of the food, and the ability to add ratings for others to see.
